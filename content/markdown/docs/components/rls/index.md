# Remote Logon Service

A small service to grab various remote login possibilities from the local
network configuration, network servers that provide them, and present
them to the user to log into for both remote applications and full remote
desktop possibilities.

Remote Logon Service facilitates remote session startup via Arctica,
X2Go, FreeRDP and Citrix's ICA Protocol.

The Remote Login Service project has originally been forked from Ubuntu's
Remote Login Service.
