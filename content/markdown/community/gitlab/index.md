# The Arctica GitLab Server

## Signing up

The possibly easiest way of signing up for an account on the Arctica GitLab Server is through Github's OpenID service.

Simply follow the _Sign in with <Github-Logo>_ link under the [site's login box](https://git.arctica-project.org).

## Contacting the Arctica GitLab site's maintainers

Once you have signed up with our GitLab site, you are logged out again, as one of the Arctica GitLab maintainers has to activate your account.

For that to happen, please subscribe to our [developer's mailing list](https://lists.arctica-project.org/listinfo/devs), send a mail to that list and introduce yourself. Please especially let us know why you want to have authenticated access to our GitLab site.

Let us know how you came across the Arctica Project and what you have in mind with it. We are interested in you, once you have come that far. We potentially see you as a resource of expertise now.

## Cloning Repositories

Once your account has been activated, please upload an SSH public key of yours into your user profile. Once that's done, you can clone hosted Git repositories via SSH.

The generic syntax for Git cloning is this:

```

$ git clone git@git.arctica-project.org:<group>/<git-project>.git
```

So, for example, the ``build.git`` repositories in the nx-X11-rebase group can be cloned like this:

```

$ git clone git@git.arctica-project.org:nx-X11-rebase/build.git
```

We are looking forward to your participation. In whatever that may be.
