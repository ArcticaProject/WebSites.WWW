# The Arctica Project's Community

The Arctica Project is a Free Software project intending to bring forth a
remote computing framework of enterprise grade and quality.

The Arctica Project's greatest resource is people that contribute. People
that feel attracted by what we do, people that join in and become part of our team.

We invite you to get in touch with us...

## Collaborative Development

The majority of code published by The Arctica Project is maintained on
[Github](https://github.com/ArcticaProject).

Some bleeding edge, experimental or otherwise categorized code may also be published on our [GitLab](./gitlab) site.

All code we publish has been and always will be licensed under a Free
Software license (mostly one of the GPL'ish licenses).

## Bug tracking

For bug tracking, depending on where the "buggy" code is hosted, we either use Github's issue trackers or the issue trackers provided by our [GitLab](./gitlab) instance.
